# Samples

TypeStyle is simply just a `style` function with a handful of *simple* utilities that we cover nicely in the rest of the book. So don't need another hello world here. That said, the best samples are real world usages. Here are a few: 

* [http://matrixmultiplication.xyz/](http://matrixmultiplication.xyz/) Built with TypeStyle / CycleJS / TypeScript
* [This website, with docs](https://github.com/typestyle/typestyle.github.io) as well as [the playground](http://typestyle.io/play) are all built 100% with typestyle.
* [alm.tools](http://alm.tools) and IDE designed to provide the best developer experience for TypeScript.
